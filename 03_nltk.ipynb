They won\\'t be able to keep their laughter \"burro\"-ed. You show a picture of the cutest little ol\\' donkey you ever saw. But the poor fellow is missing his tail. Slide the donkey picture into an envelope with a large window. A child pretends to throw the tail, and when you pull out the donkey, the tail is stuck to his nose. His eyes are crossed and his ears bent back in surprise. Kids howl. It\\'s not the helper\\'s fault -- you know how stubborn donkeys are.Put it back in, try again, and this time when you pull it out, the tail is completely gone. You look all around for it, and suddenly the kids scream their lungs out because the tail is hanging out of the back of your pants. Trust me on this, the children will weep with joy. This bit of tomfoolery can be used in a variety of settings. Based on an idea by Edwin Hooper with a twist by Selina Frederick. Using Selina\\'s wonderful artwork, TAIL SPIN is printed in full color on heavy boards with a high-gloss finish. You\\'re bound to get a KICK out of this one.

The piece with the caterpillar at the bottom is obviously longer, but you tell your audience that they are forever growing longer. When the shorter caterpillar on top is \"stretched\" and moved below the longer one, it now appears longer. This is repeated as often as you like. Eventually the caterpillars really grow up to become butterflies, and when you turn the pieces over, and there is a beautiful butterfly formed with the two pieces, and every one can see both pieces are now exactly the same size. Fun to use as a walkaround item or to give away.

Ask your audience if they have heard of the Bermuda Triangle and how planes and ships would vanish when they entered the area. After assuring your audience that you have a glass of authentic water from within the mysterious triangle, proceed to make a paper airplane and a paper boat (origami lessons not included). Drop the paper into a clear bowl of water, and watch it disappear. You can also write, print, stamp etc., on Dissolvo. To dissolve, immerse it in water and with one swish, it is gone without a trace. Works faster in warm water, slower in cold. A classic use for ministry is to have a spectator write one of his sins on the paper, and then put it in a clear glass and cover it with water. As the water is poured back and forth from one glass to another, the paper vanishes before everyone\\'s eyes. A very powerful and dramatic effect. 25 sheets, 4 1/2\" x 2 1/2\" G1218 http://www.clownantics.com/images/products/g1218.jpg 4.50 New Paper Magic & Mouth Coils Dots Impossible Magic Card Tricks http://www.clownantics.com/dots-impossible-magic-card-trick/dots-impossible-magic-card-tricks-515-23-p.html Six cards are placed face-down on the table and a spectator freely chooses one.

Completely 100% edible (and tasty) soup is canned with this fabulous Hobo logo making it a perfect prop for the well fed tramp. Our recommendation - empty the can for a lighter clown suitcase. This soup was the brainchild of a small-town newspaperman from Minnesota, who in 1953 went into the local hobo camps in search of a feature story. As a result he was treated to old-fashioned homemade hobo soup and felt the world should share in this down-to-earth cuisine. Made with beans, potatoes, carrots, tomatoes, celery, onions, and turnips, and flavored with bacon to give it a satisfying smoky taste, this thick and hearty vegetable soup is literally a meal in itself. Simply heat and eat. 15 oz. per can.

F15862 http://www.clownantics.com/images/products/f15862.jpg 10.00 New Glitter Jim Howle \"That\" Restickable Adhesive http://www.clownantics.com/jim-howle-that-restickable-adhesiv/jim-howle-that-restickable-adhesive-886-416-p.html If your nose is a well-fitting one, \"THAT\" glue will work the best. The NON-LATEX formula has a special restickable ability which allows you to remove and reattach the nose several times without having to reapply the glue. So this 1.25 oz. bottle goes a long way. For best results, wipe your nose with alcohol to remove any oil that may prevent optimum adhesion. Place a drop of adhesive inside the clown nose and smear it where it will do the most good. Rub a drop on your own nose and rub it in. Let dry for 5 minutes before putting your clown nose on. Leave the glue inside the nose as long as it works...then add a little more when the old stuff stops working -- simple as that. Easy to clean with a baby wipe.

No problem. Jim Howle\\'s Putty is the perfect solution. Container holds a ping-pong ball sized glob (22 grams), which should last you a long, long time. For best results, first wipe your nose, clown nose, and hands with alcohol on a paper towel to take off all the makeup, oil, and dirt, sweat. Pull off a little bit of the putty and knead it until it sticks annoyingly to your fingers. Hold the nose upside down and fill the top (the part that is closest to the bridge of your nose) and work it half-way down the sides. Try it on and keep packing more until you have the fit you want. Try NOT to put any Putty in the very front or bottom -- this will shift the weight in the nose and may make it fall off. To remove: just dab the main glob of remaining Putty to lift off the used stuff and store back in container -- the Putty can be re-used over and over again as long as you keep the container tightly closed. If you can take the time to use the Putty correctly, you will REALLY like its properties. For use with Jim Howle Acrylic Noses.

Wonderful though they are, the cards aren\\'t much good for performing with, so to make the most of the gift, you change the hand-illustrated cards into an honest-to-goodness factory printed deck. With the brand new deck, a mind reading effect is demonstrated and proves a hit. Then, wracked with guilt at changing the beautiful gift into a model of magical conformity, you reverse the process, changing the cards back into the deck you started with - simply illustrated cards. Each Kids Kards deck comes complete and ready to work.

The Thread Reel is designed to allow you easy access to the thread whenever you need it. Invisible thread is perfect for use in levitation and animation effects, the most famous of which is \"Fred Kap\\'s Floating and Dancing Cork,\" where a cork floats in midair right under a spectator\\'s nose. Includes information on attaching objects to the thread, lighting conditions, and several ideas for use as well as tips on handling the Thread Reel.

On this DVD, professional magician Kirk Charles explores the workings of a marked deck and demonstrates its use in over one dozen stunning tricks. From mind reading effects to supposed demonstrations of super-skills, Charles shows how this subtle yet powerful magical tool can be developed into a devious secret weapon in any magicians bag of tricks. You will learn how to instantly memorize the order of the entire deck, tell the difference between black and red cards - apparently by weight alone, analyze a spectators handwriting as if you were an expert graphologist, determine the name of a spectators selected card - before even he knows its identity, and much more. In addition to tricks, Charles discusses the psychology behind working with a marked deck and how to conceal its presence from an audience. Years of careful study and practice are laid bare on Miracles with a Marked Deck. Charles also talks about the history and background of marked decks, and the development of modern marking systems including the popular Boris Wild Marked Deck (see below). Kirk Charles is a professional magician living in Seattle, Washington.

About tonight’s show…(cross-posted fucking everywhere) Posted in My Big, Black Cock. on February 28th, 2006 by Scott Crawford It was alright. ;) I’d like to thank in no particular order: the Academy, Kage for gutting this whole “rock” thing out with me and kicking ass on anything that I (or the sound crews of various venues) throw at him, The Audacity and The Funeral Crashers for having us on the bill and for doing what they do, Continental for having us all there and providing a great backstage atmosphere (“It was totally like a fuckin’ concert, dude…”), Kristine Rose for handling merch and mailing list for all the bands (and Clif for getting her there and back), Blake for bringing the big camera and filming us in the mens’ room, everyone who came out tonight (especially those who stuck around late to catch me, but thanks go to all of you just for showin’ up…), and finally, thanks even go to everyone who didn’t make it but wanted to! For those of you who fit that last category, your interest is noted and appreciated, and we’ll do our best to give you another chance to catch us soon! On that front, we’ll have an announcement as soon as dates are finalized. Until then, we’re going straight back to the lab and recording some more fun stuff for you to hear. More on that soon, too.

Juni 2011 findet der 4. Random Hacks of Kindness statt. RHoK ist ein an vielen Orten der Welt gleichzeitig und wiederholt stattfindender Programmierwettbewerb, der ein ganzes Wochenende dauert. Zum zweiten Mal wird es dabei auch im Betahaus in Berlin ein lokales Event geben. Die RHoK-Anwendungen sollen in Krisensituationen helfen oder der Prävention und dem Schutz dienen. Dies können sowohl plötzliche Ereignisse sein (Erdbeben, Überschwemmungen, Terroristische Angriffe, Buschfeuer) als auch vorhersagbare Ereignisse (Monsunregen, Grippeepidemien…) oder auch längerfristige Krisen wie in Unruheherden, Gebieten mit chronischer Unterernährung, hohen AIDS-Raten, dauernden Dürren oder Auswirkungen des globalen Klimawandels. [via] Kategorien: Soziale Netzwerke, Termine 28. Mai 2011, 07:55 Uhr Kommentieren Hacking Club-Mate Von StefanMz Club-Mate ist nicht nur hierzulande beliebt, sondern auch in den USA. Dort bekommt man das Getränk jedoch nur schwer, und wenn, dann zu hohen Preisen. Was liegt näher, als sich das Zeug selber zu brauen? Das ist jetzt geschehen, wobei es schon mehrere Hacks gibt. Der Hackerspace HackPittsburgh hat Open Mate kreiert, das Rezept ist super einfach. Der Interlock-Hackerspace in Rochester hat mit Open Mate Beta 2 eine mehr zitronige Variante vom Pittburgh-Rezept abgeleitet — offene Quellen machen’s möglich. Noisebridge ist ein Hackerspace in San Francisco, ihr Rezept-Remix heißt Sudo Pop und ist ein Ginger-Beer. Glaubt man dem MAKE-Magazine, so ist Dave-Mate geschmacklich am nächsten am Original — hier das Rezept. [via] Kategorien: Freie Inhalte 25. Mai 2011, 13:39 Uhr 3 Kommentare Was kann ein »Jenseits des Wachstums« bedeuten? Von Andreas Exner Einleitungsworte beim Kongress »Jenseits des Wachstums?!« Weltweit dominiert die kapitalistische Produktionsweise das Leben der Menschen. Sie unterliegt einem Drang und Zwang zum Wachstum, der sozial und ökologisch verheerend ist. Anders als historisch ältere Formen von Wirtschaft, die zum Teil Märkte inkludierten, ist die kapitalistische Produktionsweise wesentlich Marktwirtschaft. Sogar die Lebenszeit wird zur Ware.

Mai 2011, 19:35 Uhr 4 Kommentare Commons, Nachhaltigkeit und Diskurssprung Von StefanMz Eine wiederkehrende Kritik an digitalen Commons (wie Freier Software, Wikipedia, Freier Kultur etc.) lautet, dass sie die Tatsache ignorierten, dass eine physikalische Infrastruktur — die Kabel, Computer, Stromversorgung etc. — die Voraussetzung für das Commoning (die Commons-Praxis) ist. Diese verbrauche ganz konventionell stoffliche Ressourcen, und das nicht zu knapp, so dass es Augenwischerei sei, auf die fast aufwandsfreie Kopierbarkeit der digitalen Güter zu verweisen. Die Praxis der digitalen Commons sei im Gegensatz zu vielen traditionellen Commons nicht nachhaltig. Stimmt dieser Vorwurf? Vollständigen Artikel lesen » Kategorien: Commons, Theorie 20.

Von Christian Siefkes Wie gleichberechtigt und freiwillig produziert werden kann [Der folgende Artikel wurde in der Oya 8 veröffentlicht, deren Thema das „Geldbeben“ ist.] Das Geld spielt in unserer Gesellschaft eine so große Rolle, dass es schwierig ist, sich eine Welt ohne Geld vorzustellen. Arbeiten die Menschen nicht nur, um Geld zu verdienen? Würden Firmen ohne die Erwartung von Profiten etwas produzieren? Wahrscheinlich eher nicht. Doch für das Tun der Menschen spielt das Geld keine so große Rolle, wie man gewöhnlich denkt. Weniger als 40 Prozent der in Deutschland geleisteten Arbeiten werden bezahlt, der größere Teil wird nicht entlohnt: Tätigkeiten im Haushalt, private Pflege- und Betreuungsleistungen sowie ehrenamtliche Tätigkeiten. Gerade weil sie unbezahlt sind, werden diese Tätigkeiten in unserer Gesellschaft meist nicht sehr ernst genommen, doch ohne sie würde alles zusammenbrechen. Und sie demonstrieren eindrucksvoll, dass Menschen für andere nützliche Dinge tun, auch wenn sie nicht mit Geld „bestochen“ werden.

Mai 2011, 00:04 Uhr 1 Kommentar Rezension »Netz-Widerstand« Von StefanMz (Rezension erschienen in: »Das Argument«, Nr. 291/2011) Winter, Rainer, u. Sonja Kutschera-Groinig, Widerstand im Netz. Zur Herausbildung einer transnationalen Öffentlichkeit durch netzbasierte Kommunikation, transcript, Bielefeld 2010 (165 S., br., 18,80 €) Mit dem Forschungsansatz der Cultural Studies wird die soziale Entfaltung von netzbasierten kommunikativen Praktiken jenseits einer globalen »Kontrollgesellschaft« (Deleuze) untersucht. Diese werden durch die Stichworte »Online-Aktivismus« und »Kosmopolitismus« umrissen. Zu den widerständigen Netzwerken zählen Verf. die verschiedenen Alternativ- und Kampagnenmedien von sozialen Bewegungen und Protestgruppen, aber auch solche von Subkulturen, Hobbyisten und Fans. Als Teil der Zivilgesellschaft haben sie ihren medialen Netzraum neben Markt und Staat errungen und leisten »symbolischen Widerstand gegen neoliberale marktwirtschaftliche Ideologien« (74).

Mai 2011, 07:38 Uhr 1 Kommentar Rezension »Google-Komplex« Von StefanMz (Rezension erschienen in: »Das Argument«, Nr. 291/2011) Röhle, Theo, Der Google-Komplex. Über Macht im Zeitalter des Internets, transcript, Bielefeld 2010 (261 S., br., 24,80 €) Während in bekannten Dystopien wie Orwells 1984 der Staat als allmächtiger Moloch über die isolierten Individuen herrscht, hat sich diese Funktion im neoliberalisierten Kapitalismus eine private Firma gesichert: Google. Doch statt Dämonisierung ist kühle Analyse angebracht, denn »Macht im Zeitalter des Internets« sei nicht mit unidirektionalen Top-Down-Konzepten zu begreifen, sondern als Gouvernementalität statt als Souveränität, mit Foucault statt mit Hobbes, lautet Röhles argumentative Leitlinie.

Konferenzen locken vom 20. bis 22 Mai 2011 nach Berlin. Zunächst ist da der Attac-Kongress »Jenseits des Wachstums?!« in der Technischen Universität Berlin, und dann die Internationale Konferenz »Re-Thinking Marx« in der Humboldt Universität Berlin. Aus Platzspar-Gründen habe ich mal beide Logos kombiniert. Ergibt das Sinn? Hätte Marx sich einen wachstumsgebremsten Kapitalismus vorstellen können? [Update] Einen hab ich noch: Wer’s eher traditionell mag — Klassenkampf und Pulverdampf — geht über Himmelfahrt (2.-5- Juni) zum Kongress »Marx Is Muss«. Kategorien: Termine 11.

About tonight’s show…(cross-posted fucking everywhere) Posted in My Big, Black Cock. on February 28th, 2006 by Scott Crawford It was alright. ;) I’d like to thank in no particular order: the Academy, Kage for gutting this whole “rock” thing out with me and kicking ass on anything that I (or the sound crews of various venues) throw at him, The Audacity and The Funeral Crashers for having us on the bill and for doing what they do, Continental for having us all there and providing a great backstage atmosphere (“It was totally like a fuckin’ concert, dude…”), Kristine Rose for handling merch and mailing list for all the bands (and Clif for getting her there and back), Blake for bringing the big camera and filming us in the mens’ room, everyone who came out tonight (especially those who stuck around late to catch me, but thanks go to all of you just for showin’ up…), and finally, thanks even go to everyone who didn’t make it but wanted to! For those of you who fit that last category, your interest is noted and appreciated, and we’ll do our best to give you another chance to catch us soon! On that front, we’ll have an announcement as soon as dates are finalized. Until then, we’re going straight back to the lab and recording some more fun stuff for you to hear. More on that soon, too. Stay tuned to the Scott Crawford MySpace page for the latest, and thanks as always for giving a damn. =) Stay beautiful, dahlings… -S Leave A Comment » spamspamspamwhorewhorewhore pimppimppimppushpushpush Posted in My Big, Black Cock., Upcoming Events. on February 26th, 2006 by Scott Crawford Scott Crawford with The Audacity and The Funeral Crashers Monday, February 27th, 2006, 9:30 PM Continental 25 Third Avenue (between St. Marks Place & 9th St.) New York, NY 10003 (212) 529-6924 Be there!

They kinda look like two earthworms fuckin’ in the grass when they do that. Leave A Comment » No shame whatsoever. Posted in My Big, Black Cock. on February 1st, 2006 by Scott Crawford Man, I’m a whore. Actually, I was just removing items from it, trimming it down a little (by over 1/3, scarily enough…), and I figured I’d post it. If you’re nice little money slaves and buy me things from it, maybe I’ll show you some pink, tee hee! *batting eyelashes* Leave A Comment » © 2000-2008 Scott Crawford On January 24th, 2001...

Juni 2011 findet der 4. Random Hacks of Kindness statt. RHoK ist ein an vielen Orten der Welt gleichzeitig und wiederholt stattfindender Programmierwettbewerb, der ein ganzes Wochenende dauert. Zum zweiten Mal wird es dabei auch im Betahaus in Berlin ein lokales Event geben. Die RHoK-Anwendungen sollen in Krisensituationen helfen oder der Prävention und dem Schutz dienen. Dies können sowohl plötzliche Ereignisse sein (Erdbeben, Überschwemmungen, Terroristische Angriffe, Buschfeuer) als auch vorhersagbare Ereignisse (Monsunregen, Grippeepidemien…) oder auch längerfristige Krisen wie in Unruheherden, Gebieten mit chronischer Unterernährung, hohen AIDS-Raten, dauernden Dürren oder Auswirkungen des globalen Klimawandels.

Dort bekommt man das Getränk jedoch nur schwer, und wenn, dann zu hohen Preisen. Was liegt näher, als sich das Zeug selber zu brauen? Das ist jetzt geschehen, wobei es schon mehrere Hacks gibt. Der Hackerspace HackPittsburgh hat Open Mate kreiert, das Rezept ist super einfach. Der Interlock-Hackerspace in Rochester hat mit Open Mate Beta 2 eine mehr zitronige Variante vom Pittburgh-Rezept abgeleitet — offene Quellen machen’s möglich. Noisebridge ist ein Hackerspace in San Francisco, ihr Rezept-Remix heißt Sudo Pop und ist ein Ginger-Beer. Glaubt man dem MAKE-Magazine, so ist Dave-Mate geschmacklich am nächsten am Original — hier das Rezept. [via] Kategorien: Freie Inhalte 25. Mai 2011, 13:39 Uhr 3 Kommentare Was kann ein »Jenseits des Wachstums« bedeuten? Von Andreas Exner Einleitungsworte beim Kongress »Jenseits des Wachstums?!« Weltweit dominiert die kapitalistische Produktionsweise das Leben der Menschen. Sie unterliegt einem Drang und Zwang zum Wachstum, der sozial und ökologisch verheerend ist. Anders als historisch ältere Formen von Wirtschaft, die zum Teil Märkte inkludierten, ist die kapitalistische Produktionsweise wesentlich Marktwirtschaft. Sogar die Lebenszeit wird zur Ware.

Mai 2011, 19:35 Uhr 4 Kommentare Commons, Nachhaltigkeit und Diskurssprung Von StefanMz Eine wiederkehrende Kritik an digitalen Commons (wie Freier Software, Wikipedia, Freier Kultur etc.) lautet, dass sie die Tatsache ignorierten, dass eine physikalische Infrastruktur — die Kabel, Computer, Stromversorgung etc. — die Voraussetzung für das Commoning (die Commons-Praxis) ist. Diese verbrauche ganz konventionell stoffliche Ressourcen, und das nicht zu knapp, so dass es Augenwischerei sei, auf die fast aufwandsfreie Kopierbarkeit der digitalen Güter zu verweisen. Die Praxis der digitalen Commons sei im Gegensatz zu vielen traditionellen Commons nicht nachhaltig. Stimmt dieser Vorwurf? Vollständigen Artikel lesen » Kategorien: Commons, Theorie 20.

Von Christian Siefkes Wie gleichberechtigt und freiwillig produziert werden kann [Der folgende Artikel wurde in der Oya 8 veröffentlicht, deren Thema das „Geldbeben“ ist.] Das Geld spielt in unserer Gesellschaft eine so große Rolle, dass es schwierig ist, sich eine Welt ohne Geld vorzustellen. Arbeiten die Menschen nicht nur, um Geld zu verdienen? Würden Firmen ohne die Erwartung von Profiten etwas produzieren? Wahrscheinlich eher nicht. Doch für das Tun der Menschen spielt das Geld keine so große Rolle, wie man gewöhnlich denkt. Weniger als 40 Prozent der in Deutschland geleisteten Arbeiten werden bezahlt, der größere Teil wird nicht entlohnt: Tätigkeiten im Haushalt, private Pflege- und Betreuungsleistungen sowie ehrenamtliche Tätigkeiten. Gerade weil sie unbezahlt sind, werden diese Tätigkeiten in unserer Gesellschaft meist nicht sehr ernst genommen, doch ohne sie würde alles zusammenbrechen. Und sie demonstrieren eindrucksvoll, dass Menschen für andere nützliche Dinge tun, auch wenn sie nicht mit Geld „bestochen“ werden.

Mai 2011, 00:04 Uhr 1 Kommentar Rezension »Netz-Widerstand« Von StefanMz (Rezension erschienen in: »Das Argument«, Nr. 291/2011) Winter, Rainer, u. Sonja Kutschera-Groinig, Widerstand im Netz. Zur Herausbildung einer transnationalen Öffentlichkeit durch netzbasierte Kommunikation, transcript, Bielefeld 2010 (165 S., br., 18,80 €) Mit dem Forschungsansatz der Cultural Studies wird die soziale Entfaltung von netzbasierten kommunikativen Praktiken jenseits einer globalen »Kontrollgesellschaft« (Deleuze) untersucht. Diese werden durch die Stichworte »Online-Aktivismus« und »Kosmopolitismus« umrissen. Zu den widerständigen Netzwerken zählen Verf. die verschiedenen Alternativ- und Kampagnenmedien von sozialen Bewegungen und Protestgruppen, aber auch solche von Subkulturen, Hobbyisten und Fans. Als Teil der Zivilgesellschaft haben sie ihren medialen Netzraum neben Markt und Staat errungen und leisten »symbolischen Widerstand gegen neoliberale marktwirtschaftliche Ideologien« (74).

Mai 2011, 07:38 Uhr 1 Kommentar Rezension »Google-Komplex« Von StefanMz (Rezension erschienen in: »Das Argument«, Nr. 291/2011) Röhle, Theo, Der Google-Komplex. Über Macht im Zeitalter des Internets, transcript, Bielefeld 2010 (261 S., br., 24,80 €) Während in bekannten Dystopien wie Orwells 1984 der Staat als allmächtiger Moloch über die isolierten Individuen herrscht, hat sich diese Funktion im neoliberalisierten Kapitalismus eine private Firma gesichert: Google. Doch statt Dämonisierung ist kühle Analyse angebracht, denn »Macht im Zeitalter des Internets« sei nicht mit unidirektionalen Top-Down-Konzepten zu begreifen, sondern als Gouvernementalität statt als Souveränität, mit Foucault statt mit Hobbes, lautet Röhles argumentative Leitlinie.

Konferenzen locken vom 20. bis 22 Mai 2011 nach Berlin. Zunächst ist da der Attac-Kongress »Jenseits des Wachstums?!« in der Technischen Universität Berlin, und dann die Internationale Konferenz »Re-Thinking Marx« in der Humboldt Universität Berlin. Aus Platzspar-Gründen habe ich mal beide Logos kombiniert. Ergibt das Sinn? Hätte Marx sich einen wachstumsgebremsten Kapitalismus vorstellen können? [Update] Einen hab ich noch: Wer’s eher traditionell mag — Klassenkampf und Pulverdampf — geht über Himmelfahrt (2.-5- Juni) zum Kongress »Marx Is Muss«. Kategorien: Termine 11.
